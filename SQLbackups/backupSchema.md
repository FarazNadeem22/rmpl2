# Backup and Restore MySQL Schema

To replicate the schema on a different PC, you can use the `mysqldump` tool to export only the schema (without the data) from your MySQL database. This allows you to create a backup of the database structure, including tables, indexes, and constraints, which you can then import on another PC.

## Step-by-Step Instructions to Backup and Restore the Schema Only

### Step 1: Use `mysqldump` to Create the Schema Backup

1. **Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)**.

2. **Run the `mysqldump` command to export the schema**:
   Replace `root` with your MySQL username, and `IssueTickets` with the name of your database.

   ```sh
   mysqldump -u root -p --no-data IssueTickets > IssueTickets_schema_backup.sql
